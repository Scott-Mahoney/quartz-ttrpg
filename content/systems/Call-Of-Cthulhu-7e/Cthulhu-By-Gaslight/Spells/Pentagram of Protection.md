> # Pentagram of Protection
> 
> ###### General Information
> 	A protective pentacle symbol (a pentagram surrounded by a circle), sketched in the air using a ritual knife made from steel. Cast on the Material Plane, this spell provides 2D10 hours of protection from the attention of Astral Vermin (above), and actively repels these creatures-though it will not dislodge one that is already feeding. This spell must be cast on the Material Plane-it cannot be cast on the Astral Plane because it's not possible to take a steel knife there.
> 	
> 	Note: The Golden Dawn encourages its occultists to cast this spell reflexively, multiple times a day-on waking, before sleep, and before every ritual or spell casting-to ensure they are always warded from the predations of the astral vermin.
