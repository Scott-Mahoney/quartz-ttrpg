> # Amulet of Astral Protection
> 
> ###### General Information
> 	This spell may only be cast in conjunction with a successful Hermetic Ritual (page 51) skill roll. The casting process involves personal cleansing for one week, and then crafting, consecrating, and attuning an amulet-a gem of schorl (black tourmaline) inscribed with the Sixth Pentacle of Mars. The process demands that the caster also immerses themselves at sunrise and sunset in cold fresh water; abstains from work, sex, alcohol, drugs, and any sustenance except bread and water; and that they spend most of their free waking hours in a calm, meditative (or prayerful) state. No other spells may be cast while this week-long process takes place. A successful POW roll indicates that the occultist's willpower holds out that long.

> 	Once created, the amulet protects the wearer's body from astral intrusion, such as stopping a Terror from Beyond taking a bite out of the holder's physical body, or acting to prevent possession by a ghost, astral predator, or other native of the Astral Plane-which monsters this category encompasses is determined by the Keeper. The amulet does not provide protection in astral combat or prevent astral attack, it simply ensures that the holder's body remains inviolate. Lastly, the amulet also repels any astral vermin attempting to attach to the wearer; the vermin falls away and withers like a leaky balloon and then dies.

> 	The amulet can be a gift to another person, but unless it is given freely and willingly, it has no protective power for them.
