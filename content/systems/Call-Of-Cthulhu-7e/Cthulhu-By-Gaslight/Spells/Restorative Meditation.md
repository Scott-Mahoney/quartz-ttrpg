> # Restorative Meditation
> 
> ###### General Information
> 	A technique that provides mental restoration through long-form meditation. The caster isolates from all worldly influences for a period of at least one month, during which time they must focus only upon meditation and ritual purification. At the end of this time of deep contemplation, they can attempt a Sanity roll: if successful, they have 1D6 Sanity points restored. Points recovered with this technique can never exceed the maximum amount permitted ( 99 minus their Cthulhu Mythos skill).
> 	
> 	A fumbled Sanity roll means that something corrupted the meditation, twisting the person's thoughts to focus on and relive anguish previously suffered. Such unfortunates lose 1D6 Sanity points rather than gain them. The isolation and meditation can be extended in the hope that another month's work will result in a better outcome. Two continuous months is the maximum duration one may devote to this "spell." After that, no further Sanity gain or loss is possible.
