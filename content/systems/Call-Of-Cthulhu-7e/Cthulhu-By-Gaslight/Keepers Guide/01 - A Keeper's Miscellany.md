*“Life and death went hand in hand; wealth and poverty stood side by side; repletion and starvation laid them down together. But it was London.”*
*—Charles Dickens, Nicholas Nickleby (1839)*

This chapter functions as an extension of the Cthulhu by Gaslight: Investigators’ Guide; it provides further historical background, particularly for those aspects of society that are not known to the public at large—more detail on institutions only accessed by the penniless and destitute; on prisons; on asylums; and on crimes of the Gaslight era. There’s also a selection of useful floorplans and villainous organizations.

In addition, within are details about the rule of law, and the criminal underworld. Fair warning: Victorian society was rife with exclusion, discrimination, and oppression based on class, gender, sexuality, and race—though not always along the lines modern readers may expect—as well as new and unexpected opportunities for the fortunate.

# Desperate Measures
The “Poor Laws” of the 18th and 19th centuries placed the responsibility of caring for the destitute on local parishes. Applicants could only apply for public assistance to the parish of their permanent residence. This could be in the form of “outdoor relief,” i.e., financial or material assistance given to people in their own homes, or on the street.

The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 largely abolished outdoor relief and made it so that anyone
requiring assistance had to enter a workhouse instead and submit to a regime of forced labour. It was an egregious, regressive piece of legislation designed primarily to reduce this burden of public assistance upon local taxpayers. Its explicit purpose was to make falling back on public welfare so awful that the poor would do literally anything else instead, the assumption being that poverty was a lifestyle choice. The “Bastardy Clause” also absolved the father of any illegitimate child of all financial responsibility, putting the entire burden on the mother.

- 1872: Infant Life Protection Act—requires foster carers to register with the parish.
- 1897: Infant Life Protection Act—allows local authorities to regulate child carers.

# The Workhouse
As the 19th century progressed, different parishes “clubbed together” in response to the needs of the
rising population to form poor law unions and construct workhouses capable of caring for the
poor of dozens of parishes. An annually elected Board of Guardians, all wealthy taxpayers, runs each workhouse. After 1871, oversight of the workhouse system goes to the Local Government Board, whose president is a government Cabinet Minister.

The prospect of the workhouse instils utter fear and shame in the working classes, especially as they grow older—though unemployment, illness, and disease can also drive people there. It is not an exaggeration to state that many people literally starve to death instead of submitting to the workhouse. It is not simply the horrible physical conditions, but the humiliation, the loss of autonomy, and the separation from family that amounts to a surrender of the sense of self. Entry to a
workhouse is voluntary for adults, and “inmates” can, in theory, leave with a few hours’ notice—although they must pay off the previous day’s relief with work, married men may not leave their wives behind, and parents must take their children with them to prevent the dumping of unwanted offspring on the parish. As well as adults, abandoned children and orphans can end up in the workhouse as a means to care for them, though in the late-Victorian era there are an estimated
30,000 orphaned or abandoned children living on Britain’s streets. Leaving while still in workhouse
uniform results in a charge of theft and, until 1911, married women cannot leave the workhouse without permission from their husband.

The workhouse doors are always locked, but open at 6:00 pm each evening for those hoping for a bed
in a “casual ward,” which is separate to the rest of the establishment. At facilities with limited capacity, applicants may begin queuing much earlier. The casual wards house the vagrants and “destitute wanderers,” such as construction workers or laborers (“Navvies”) walking between jobs. In return for a morning’s work, the recipient gets a bath, a bag of straw to sleep on in a common room (though workhouses built after 1870 introduce individual cells that lock from the outside), supper, and breakfast. Staff temporarily confiscate any tobacco, money, and alcohol, and segregate the sexes.
From 1882, those entering a casual ward must stay for two nights, with a full day’s work between. Applicants may not return to the same casual ward for 30 days.

The relieving officer conducts interviews with those who wish to enter the workhouse indefinitely, and issues a certificate (“chitty”) permitting this. To qualify for permanent workhouse residence, a person must belong to the parish—for men, this usually means having lived and worked there for a year; women and children qualify based on the husband/father’s “right of settlement.” Most workhouses require married men to bring their dependents with them, and they might turn away a woman if she has family that could notionally provide for her, especially if she admits to being married. Upon entry into the workhouse proper, the staff sort inmates into the following categories:
- Men infirm through age or illness.
- Women infirm through age or illness.
- Able-bodied men aged 15-60 years.
- Able-bodied women aged 15-60 years.
- Boys aged between 7 and 14.
- Girls aged between 7 and 14.
- Children under the age of 7.

Each person receives a bath, a medical examination, and a “workhouse dress” (which resembles a uniform)—workhouse staff store away personal clothing and possessions in case the inmate should choose to leave. They separate the families, except for children under the age of two, sometimes never to see each other again, as each category is allocated to a communal dormitory, with segregated dining and work areas. It is this separation that most frightens inmates. Desperate
overcrowding exists in all areas and facilities, and architects set the windows and walls to prevent any view of the outside world.

The master, who lives on site, is in overall control of the workhouse and its staff; the matron (usually his wife) oversees the women and children under seven years. 

To earn their rations (which law dictates must be worse than those of the local poor) inmates must clean, cook, break rocks for road-making, pick the pitch from old ropes by hand to make oakum fibre, or smash bones to make fertilizer. Law dictates that children must study their letters and numbers for three hours a day, along with marketable skills to help them find work. Staff sequester the sick to the infirmary, and while the elderly must work, they sometimes receive slightly easier tasks such as sack-making or cleaning—but such conditions depend on the master of the house and the institution in question, as not all are “forward” thinking and there is, of course, abuse and corruption. Explorer Henry Morton Stanley was a workhouse child who, in his autobiography, described it as a “house of torture.” By his own account, he ran away to sea after beating up a staff member who whipped and abused a friend to death.

A typical day in a workhouse consists of breakfast at 6:30 am, followed by work from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm, a lunch from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm, then more work between 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm, with dinner served at 6:00 pm followed by bed at 8:00 pm. Compulsory Bible readings begin and end each day. Inmates do not work on Sundays, so they remain locked up except for religious services.
Staffing is usually low; fewer than a dozen staff—including a part-time Church of England chaplain—might work in an establishment catering to hundreds of inmates; workhouses must keep costs down. Discipline is harsh. Staff may restrict or withhold food for swearing or feigning sickness, and they may administer beatings with a rod to men and women alike for disorderly conduct. Many workhouses have at least one cell for solitary confinement where a person can find themselves locked up for the most minor of infractions. If the workhouses’ own deterrents are not enough, the habitually wayward inmate (one who refuses to work after receiving food, for example, or one who vandalizes workhouse property) can end up inside a prison.

Since the overall aim is to get the able-bodied off parish relief, the workhouse looks for outside employment for capable inmates—usually domestic service for women and labouring jobs for men. Children may be apprenticed to tradesmen or the factories, or sent into domestic service, by workhouse officials, without parental permission or knowledge; they are bound to that apprenticeship until they turn 21.

The workhouse can serve as an asylum for “harmless lunatics” when no other care is readily available, although in larger cities like London, purpose-built asylums cater to such folk (see Asylums, page 33). Workhouse conditions do improve over the Gaslight era, especially regarding medical care and food quality. By the end of the century, the workhouse population is largely elderly; only about 20 percent of those admitted to workhouses are unemployed or destitute, but about 30 percent of the population over 70 are in workhouses.

The ultimate humiliation, from a Victorian perspective, is the prospect of being anatomized. The Anatomy Act of 1832 permits anyone “having lawful Possession of the Body of any deceased Person” to sell that body to a medical school, and the Sanitary Act of 1866 gives lawful possession to the poor law union relieving officer, if a body in a mortuary is not claimed within 48 hours or buried within a period set locally by the authorities.

# Floorplans

The following floorplans show a range of typical homes and may provide information or serve as
potential locations for scenarios. 

## Rookeries
The slums are not mapped. Rookeries were (and should be) unmappable—they are three dimensional labyrinths where no floor matches the one below or above; clusters of jerry-built
extensions, corridors, tunnels, divided rooms, sub-basements, courtyards, lean-tos, workshops,
and kitchens. Investigators from the outside world should get lost, every time, unless they manage a
successful Navigation roll.

The most striking feature to investigators venturing within should be the overcrowding, particularly after nightfall when workers come home. Homelessness is endemic and people sleep anywhere they can. Ten unrelated people living in the same room is perfectly common, most of them young—the median age by 1901 is only 24. Mobs of children are everywhere.

A well-heeled middle-class investigator group should be constantly on-edge and feeling guilty when playing tourist in a rookery. They do not belong here, and everyone knows that. The atmosphere should be unwelcoming and tense, at least, and hostile at worst, though some inhabitants may display (or fake) fawning attention. When the investigators retreat or escape, there is an excellent
chance they’ll bring some unwanted souvenir away—lice, fleas, bedbugs, scabies, human ordure on their shoes or clothes, some sort of infection, or a rat bite. Use [[09 - Encounters#Table 1 Rookery Encounters| Table 1: Rookery Encounters (page 20)]] for inspiration and improvised encounters.

# Crime & Punishment
![[Crime and punishment.png]]

Victorian sentencing is notable in that the legal system does not treat crimes of violence (short of murder) as more egregious than crimes against property. Society treats violence among the working classes as an intractable moral failing, and it is common to receive only a few months’ imprisonment for beating someone to the verge of death. Notorious murderer Charles Peace (hanged 1879), had on a previous occasion nearly killed a policeman and received only a six-year sentence, whereas a burglary without violence earned him eight years “inside.”

## Typical sentences for common crimes
- Attempted murder: from 12 months imprisonment to 8 years of hard labor.
- Petty theft (first offense): from a caution or small fine, up to 3 to 6 months imprisonment. Birching (boys only).
- Petty theft (repeat offenses): up to 10 years hard labor. Birching (boys only).
- Housebreaking, burglary, or robbery (first offense): from 6 months hard labor to 2 years imprisonment.
- Housebreaking, burglary, or robbery (repeat offenses): up to 10 years imprisonment.
- Fraud: up to 5 years hard labor.
- Assault (first offense): a fine of up to £5, or up to 3 months imprisonment.
- Assault (repeat offenses): up to 4 years hard labor.
- Grievous bodily harm (first offense): from 12 months imprisonment to 4 years hard labor.
 - Grievous bodily harm (repeat offense): up to 7 years hard labor.

## Penalties
In 1896, for every 1,000 guilty verdicts passed, an average of 516 result in imprisonment (of which 19
include penal servitude), 194 in fines, 120 are bound over on their own recognizances, and 34 are youths who are sent to industrial or reformatory schools.

Judges have tremendous discretion over the sentences handed down for non-capital crimes. In
1878, the Home Secretary becomes aware of “serious irregularities which pervade the whole system of sentences” that experts attribute to “the personal opinions of the judges.” Social class, character witnesses, personal circumstances, and genuine penitence can make a considerable difference to the sentence handed down. First offenders are often treated leniently to get them to reform through mercy—although not always; in one instance, a man receives a sentence of seven years hard labor for stealing a hen. Repeat offenders are more likely to have the book thrown at them.

Due to Victorian attitudes about the higher nature of the female character, crimes against women almost always receive a harsher sentence than equivalent offenses committed against a man, while a woman can usually expect a lighter sentence than a man for committing the same offense. The exceptions to this are women poisoners (Victorian society is paranoid about the possibility of women poisoning their husbands) and child-murderers (who shatter the myth of maternal purity).
In addition, domestic violence is widespread and rarely punished, not least because the prosecution
must be brought by the injured party; though it is commonplace for working-class women to initiate
prosecutions against their abusive husbands simply to shame them into better behaviour, not with any desire or expectation of having them locked up—an imprisoned man can’t pay rent, after all.

Juveniles, tried in adult courts, spend their sentences in adult jails throughout the 19th century.

## Fines
Courts relatively rarely levy fines, as most criminals are not able to afford them. Magistrates and judges may impose fines if they think the criminal has the wherewithal to pay and will do so promptly.

## *Getting away with it*
*Even if investigators fall into the hands of the forces of law, there is a better than average chance they can escape legal punishment to battle the Mythos another day—if that is the Keeper’s preference. At the end of the 19th century, as many as half of all legal cases collapse before the courts reach a verdict. There is no Director of Public Prosecutions until 1880, and, even then, he does little. Justices of the Peace and other officials may prosecute “on indictment” by the coroner’s jury if there is a body, and the police may bring prosecutions if they catch a thief, but most crimes—even murder cases—are usually “by appeal” of an interested party such as a victim’s relative. Many public prosecution cases are prepared by the police who, lacking resources, time, or formal legal training, make mistakes and leave loopholes for lawyers to exploit. In minor cases, at the Keeper’s discretion, a simple Law or even Luck roll will suffice to see if a prosecution collapses before the verdict. Failing that, the judge may simply be inclined to bind the malefactor over on their own recognizance. This is a double-edged sword: what applies to investigators applies to villains too.*
## Flogging & Birching
Only a judge can pass this sentence, not a magistrate. A law passed in 1820 prohibits the flogging of women and girls. Always combined for adult men with a term of imprisonment, flogging is with either a cat o’ nine tails or the birch rod—the judge specifies which and how many strokes. The law also prevents use of the “cat” on boys under 16, but not the birch. Flogging is only for crimes of robbery with violence, vagrancy, and crimes of vice, such as importuning a minor and pimping, and for the punishment of those already incarcerated, if they break prison rules.

Authorities consider birching a particularly suitable punishment for boys aged 14 or under (16 or under in Scotland), as they view it as a relatively minor punishment and more humane than imprisonment; it’s almost always ordered as a punishment for petty theft. The birch used is smaller and lighter than the ones used on adult men in prison. After 1879, it takes the form of an immediate birching by a policeman, to a maximum of 12 strokes, in the nearest police station or sometimes in the court building itself.

## Hard labour
Also known as penal servitude. Any lengthy prison term may include at least a period of hard labour. By the Prison Act (1865), every male prisoner over 16 sentenced to a “term with hard labour” must spend at least three months of his sentence in this way. Examples of such labour include rock-breaking or road-building on a chain gang, oakum-picking (untwisting old ropes), mailbag sewing, or netmaking. The work is intentionally tiring and monotonous—the better to teach inmates the error of their ways and break their will. Some prisons have workshops where inmates make useful items such as shoes and furniture. Where meaningful labour is not available, futile labour is the substitute.

The penal treadmill is a rotating, stepped device that prisoners must climb. A stint on the treadmill
consists of 15 minutes climbing, followed by five minutes rest, for six hours a day. It may power prison machinery, such as a pump or a flour mill, or the energy may simply go to waste (known as “grinding the wind”). Alternatively, the crank machine consists of a small wheel, like the wheel of a paddle steamer, and a handle, which, turned by the prisoner, makes it revolve in a box partially filled with sand. A counter on the crank ensures that the prisoner works hard enough to “earn” his meals.
By 1895, use of these devices is falling off; there are only 39 treadmills and 29 cranks in use in English
prisons, and legislation abolishes them entirely soon after the turn of the century.

## Life Sentences
It is important to note that in Britain, even in the 19th century, a “life sentence” does not mean “the rest of your life.” Generally, it means not less than seven years, and is usually a decade or so. The actual length of time served depends on the attitude of the prisoner—are they cooperative, non-violent, and humble? Do they appear to have seen the error of their ways? Do they still
represent a threat to law and order? Also considered is the level of public interest in their release.

Campaigns by high-profile figures, influential persons, the press, or large numbers of the public,
can shorten sentences considerably. It is quite unusual for “Lifers” to die of old age inside prison;
they almost always end up out “on License” once they start to become decrepit—typically, they end up in the workhouse at this point. From 1877, such decisions rest with the Prison Commission, and may be directed by the Home Secretary, who also recommends the appointment, by royal warrant, of the Commissioners.

## Prisons
By the latter part of the 19th century, prison reformers have ensured that life in prison is no longer quite the miserable hellhole it once was, with with unlit common rooms where prisoners of every type were crammed together. The ending of transportation to the colonies in 1868 means that many new prisons appear out of necessity—90 of them by 1870. In general, these now allow light and space, and prisoners have their own cell with adequate sanitation facilities.

The prison diet is nutritious, if extremely monotonous—for some criminals, it might be the best meals they will ever eat. Prisoners doing hard labour receive an adequate diet to ensure they are fit enough to carry out their sentence. Incarceration’s objective is to perform both a deterrent and reforming effect; strict discipline without undue pain is the intention. Each cell in Milburn Prison has a single window that emits light from a central courtyard, and holds a washing tub, a wooden stool, a bed, and several “improving books,” including a Bible, a prayer book, a hymn-book, and an arithmetic book.

The reality is, of course, much harsher than the stated intention. “Hard labour, hard fare, and a hard
bed” is the overall culture. After 1865, all prisons run what authorities call the “separate system”
where jailers actively prevent prisoners from interacting with each other. The intention is twofold:
first, to prevent the development of conspiracies, partnerships, and the acquisition of criminal skills; and second, a belief that long periods of silent contemplation with only a Bible for company can awaken the “small quiet voice” of the conscience, resulting in inmates renouncing their life of crime and becoming contributing members of society.

Inmates in the separate system spend the first nine months of their sentence in solitary confinement before being allowed to join the main prison population. Even here, their interactions are severely limited, as during exercise periods (usually one hour per day) many prisons require inmates to wear masks that allow them to see only their feet and their food. Work takes place in the prisoner’s cell. Church services (essential for the moral development of the criminal) are mandatory; to prevent prisoners communicating, prison chapels have individual pews surrounded on three sides, forcing the members of the congregation to look at the pulpit.

Under the less staff-intensive “silent system,” more face-to-face contact might occur during communal labour and dining, and even shared accommodation, but regulations strictly forbid prisoners from speaking at all. If discovered communicating in any way, inmates face severe punishment, including a bread-and-water diet, a return to solitary confinement, and flogging.
Prisoners develop means of communicating, including singing their conversations during hymns (surrounding inmates sing louder to cover up the conversation from the warders), lip reading, sign language, and slipping notes between cracks in bricks and woodwork.

The degree of severity with which jailers enforce these regulations varies from prison to prison. Most
harsh is Pentonville Prison, an institution feared by many, while in other places discipline is relatively lax. The system remains in force until the Gladstone Committee of 1894–5, which introduces more lenient conditions. The 1898 Prisons Act effectively abolishes the solitary system; the duration of solitary confinement is now a maximum of one month.

The psychological effects of long-term isolation in prison can be devastating. Suicide rates are high.
***Keepers may wish to impose a Sanity reduction (0/1D6 loss) on those imprisoned***, to reflect the consequences of this “humane and improving regime.”
