*“Life and death went hand in hand; wealth and poverty stood side by side; repletion and starvation laid them down together. But it was London.”*
*—Charles Dickens, Nicholas Nickleby (1839)*

This chapter functions as an extension of the Cthulhu by Gaslight: Investigators’ Guide; it provides further historical background, particularly for those aspects of society that are not known to the public at large—more detail on institutions only accessed by the penniless and destitute; on prisons; on asylums; and on crimes of the Gaslight era. There’s also a selection of useful floorplans and villainous organizations.

In addition, within are details about the rule of law, and the criminal underworld. Fair warning: Victorian society was rife with exclusion, discrimination, and oppression based on class, gender, sexuality, and race—though not always along the lines modern readers may expect—as well as new and unexpected opportunities for the fortunate.

# Desperate Measures
The “Poor Laws” of the 18th and 19th centuries placed the responsibility of caring for the destitute on local parishes. Applicants could only apply for public assistance to the parish of their permanent residence. This could be in the form of “outdoor relief,” i.e., financial or material assistance given to people in their own homes, or on the street.

The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 largely abolished outdoor relief and made it so that anyone
requiring assistance had to enter a workhouse instead and submit to a regime of forced labour. It was an egregious, regressive piece of legislation designed primarily to reduce this burden of public assistance upon local taxpayers. Its explicit purpose was to make falling back on public welfare so awful that the poor would do literally anything else instead, the assumption being that poverty was a lifestyle choice. The “Bastardy Clause” also absolved the father of any illegitimate child of all financial responsibility, putting the entire burden on the mother.
- 1834: Poor Law Amendment Act—the creation of workhouses.
- 1872: Infant Life Protection Act—requires foster carers to register with the parish.
- 1897: Infant Life Protection Act—allows local authorities to regulate child carers.

# The Workhouse
As the 19th century progressed, different parishes “clubbed together” in response to the needs of the
rising population to form poor law unions and construct workhouses capable of caring for the
poor of dozens of parishes. An annually elected Board of Guardians, all wealthy taxpayers, runs each workhouse. After 1871, oversight of the workhouse system goes to the Local Government Board, whose president is a government Cabinet Minister.

The prospect of the workhouse instils utter fear and shame in the working classes, especially as they grow older—though unemployment, illness, and disease can also drive people there. It is not an exaggeration to state that many people literally starve to death instead of submitting to the workhouse. It is not simply the horrible physical conditions, but the humiliation, the loss of autonomy, and the separation from family that amounts to a surrender of the sense of self. Entry to a
workhouse is voluntary for adults, and “inmates” can, in theory, leave with a few hours’ notice—although they must pay off the previous day’s relief with work, married men may not leave their wives behind, and parents must take their children with them to prevent the dumping of unwanted offspring on the parish. As well as adults, abandoned children and orphans can end up in the workhouse as a means to care for them, though in the late-Victorian era there are an estimated
30,000 orphaned or abandoned children living on Britain’s streets. Leaving while still in workhouse
uniform results in a charge of theft and, until 1911, married women cannot leave the workhouse without permission from their husband.

The workhouse doors are always locked, but open at 6:00 pm each evening for those hoping for a bed
in a “casual ward,” which is separate to the rest of the establishment. At facilities with limited capacity, applicants may begin queuing much earlier. The casual wards house the vagrants and “destitute wanderers,” such as construction workers or laborers (“Navvies”) walking between jobs. In return for a morning’s work, the recipient gets a bath, a bag of straw to sleep on in a common room (though workhouses built after 1870 introduce individual cells that lock from the outside), supper, and breakfast. Staff temporarily confiscate any tobacco, money, and alcohol, and segregate the sexes.
From 1882, those entering a casual ward must stay for two nights, with a full day’s work between. Applicants may not return to the same casual ward for 30 days.

The relieving officer conducts interviews with those who wish to enter the workhouse indefinitely, and issues a certificate (“chitty”) permitting this. To qualify for permanent workhouse residence, a person must belong to the parish—for men, this usually means having lived and worked there for a year; women and children qualify based on the husband/father’s “right of settlement.” Most workhouses require married men to bring their dependents with them, and they might turn away a woman if she has family that could notionally provide for her, especially if she admits to being married. Upon entry into the workhouse proper, the staff sort inmates into the following categories:
- Men infirm through age or illness.
- Women infirm through age or illness.
- Able-bodied men aged 15-60 years.
- Able-bodied women aged 15-60 years.
- Boys aged between 7 and 14.
- Girls aged between 7 and 14.
- Children under the age of 7.

Each person receives a bath, a medical examination, and a “workhouse dress” (which resembles a uniform)—workhouse staff store away personal clothing and possessions in case the inmate should choose to leave. They separate the families, except for children under the age of two, sometimes never to see each other again, as each category is allocated to a communal dormitory, with segregated dining and work areas. It is this separation that most frightens inmates. Desperate
overcrowding exists in all areas and facilities, and architects set the windows and walls to prevent any view of the outside world.

The master, who lives on site, is in overall control of the workhouse and its staff; the matron (usually his wife) oversees the women and children under seven years. 

To earn their rations (which law dictates must be worse than those of the local poor) inmates must clean, cook, break rocks for road-making, pick the pitch from old ropes by hand to make oakum fibre, or smash bones to make fertilizer. Law dictates that children must study their letters and numbers for three hours a day, along with marketable skills to help them find work. Staff sequester the sick to the infirmary, and while the elderly must work, they sometimes receive slightly easier tasks such as sack-making or cleaning—but such conditions depend on the master of the house and the institution in question, as not all are “forward” thinking and there is, of course, abuse and corruption. Explorer Henry Morton Stanley was a workhouse child who, in his autobiography, described it as a “house of torture.” By his own account, he ran away to sea after beating up a staff member who whipped and abused a friend to death.

A typical day in a workhouse consists of breakfast at 6:30 am, followed by work from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm, a lunch from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm, then more work between 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm, with dinner served at 6:00 pm followed by bed at 8:00 pm. Compulsory Bible readings begin and end each day. Inmates do not work on Sundays, so they remain locked up except for religious services.
Staffing is usually low; fewer than a dozen staff—including a part-time Church of England chaplain—might work in an establishment catering to hundreds of inmates; workhouses must keep costs down. Discipline is harsh. Staff may restrict or withhold food for swearing or feigning sickness, and they may administer beatings with a rod to men and women alike for disorderly conduct. Many workhouses have at least one cell for solitary confinement where a person can find themselves locked up for the most minor of infractions. If the workhouses’ own deterrents are not enough, the habitually wayward inmate (one who refuses to work after receiving food, for example, or one who vandalizes workhouse property) can end up inside a prison.

Since the overall aim is to get the able-bodied off parish relief, the workhouse looks for outside employment for capable inmates—usually domestic service for women and labouring jobs for men. Children may be apprenticed to tradesmen or the factories, or sent into domestic service, by workhouse officials, without parental permission or knowledge; they are bound to that apprenticeship until they turn 21.

The workhouse can serve as an asylum for “harmless lunatics” when no other care is readily available, although in larger cities like London, purpose-built asylums cater to such folk (see Asylums, page 33). Workhouse conditions do improve over the Gaslight era, especially regarding medical care and food quality. By the end of the century, the workhouse population is largely elderly; only about 20 percent of those admitted to workhouses are unemployed or destitute, but about 30 percent of the population over 70 are in workhouses.

The ultimate humiliation, from a Victorian perspective, is the prospect of being anatomized. The Anatomy Act of 1832 permits anyone “having lawful Possession of the Body of any deceased Person” to sell that body to a medical school, and the Sanitary Act of 1866 gives lawful possession to the poor law union relieving officer, if a body in a mortuary is not claimed within 48 hours or buried within a period set locally by the authorities.

# Floorplans

The following floorplans show a range of typical homes and may provide information or serve as
potential locations for scenarios. 

## Rookeries
The slums are not mapped. Rookeries were (and should be) unmappable—they are three dimensional labyrinths where no floor matches the one below or above; clusters of jerry-built
extensions, corridors, tunnels, divided rooms, sub-basements, courtyards, lean-tos, workshops,
and kitchens. Investigators from the outside world should get lost, every time, unless they manage a
successful Navigation roll.

The most striking feature to investigators venturing within should be the overcrowding, particularly after nightfall when workers come home. Homelessness is endemic and people sleep anywhere they can. Ten unrelated people living in the same room is perfectly common, most of them young—the median age by 1901 is only 24. Mobs of children are everywhere.

A well-heeled middle-class investigator group should be constantly on-edge and feeling guilty when playing tourist in a rookery. They do not belong here, and everyone knows that. The atmosphere should be unwelcoming and tense, at least, and hostile at worst, though some inhabitants may display (or fake) fawning attention. When the investigators retreat or escape, there is an excellent
chance they’ll bring some unwanted souvenir away—lice, fleas, bedbugs, scabies, human ordure on their shoes or clothes, some sort of infection, or a rat bite. Use [[09 - Encounters#Table 1 Rookery Encounters| Table 1: Rookery Encounters (page 20)]] for inspiration and improvised encounters.
