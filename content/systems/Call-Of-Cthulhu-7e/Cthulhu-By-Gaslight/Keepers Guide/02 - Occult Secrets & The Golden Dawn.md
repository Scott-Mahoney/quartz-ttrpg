*“Nearly all the…gentlemen were members of secret societies and… pursued their studies in the direction of magic, deeming they could ultimately resolve the nature and use of all occult powers into a scientific system.”*
***Emma Hardinge Britten, Ghost Land (1876)***

This chapter covers various occult topics, such as séances, the inner workings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn for Keepers who wish to make use of that organization in their games, an introduction to the practice and perils of Astral travel, as well as Mythos tomes. In addition, the rules for reading Mythos tomes and casting spells are here, too.

## Occult origins of the British Empire
Doctor John Dee (1527–1608 or 1609), the court astronomer to Queen Elizabeth, and her “Royal Advisor in Mystic Secrets,” was the man who invented the term “The British Empire.” He was a passionate advocate for colonizing the Americas. In addition, he talked to “angels” and received the Enochian language from them, was an alchemist who claimed to be able to create gold, and translated the Necronomicon from Latin into English in 1586. His house was in Mortlake, west of London, where he amassed a huge occult library, but an unruly mob vandalized and ransacked his home and library while he was abroad in Bohemia. He died in poverty and obscurity after Elizabeth's successor James I rejected and stopped supporting him.

  

Sometime before May 1593, he performed a summoning ritual on the Isle of Dogs, a peninsula formed by a loop in the River Thames, east of the City of London. This ritual led to the death shortly thereafter of playwright Christopher Marlowe, designated as a sacrifice. It was this ritual that tipped the hand of chance over centuries and generations, and raised Britain up to become the first truly global imperial power. The name of the entity invoked was not recorded, but was presumably one from the pages of the Necronomicon.

The Isle of Dogs is, by the late-Victorian period, highly industrialized and the home to the West India Docks (from 1802), East India Docks (from 1806), and Millwall Dock (from 1868); however, just to the east of Millwall Dock is an open, undeveloped (and quite smelly) area known as the Mudchute, used for the dumping of silt and for football (soccer) fields, and John Dee's cobbled ritual circle is still there for all to see, marked by a curb of stones-someone has maintained it.

It is known in occult circles as the Omphalos (navel, sacred center) of Britain and is aligned to several culturally significant sites including St. Paul's Cathedral and some of Hawksmoor's Churches (see Chapter 5, page 147).

## RUNNING SÉANCES
A séance is a classic scene of Victorian literature and an ideal setting for part of an investigation. Investigators might encounter a spirit medium in either a public meeting (meeting sizes varied from small gatherings to halls filled with hundreds or even thousands of people) or a private reading, either in the medium's residence or a private home.

Public meetings are often not "materializations" (see below) but rather demonstrations of clairvoyant "tests" (i.e., "cold readings," as performed by modern, stage mind-readers), since in larger gatherings, one can play the odds. Some mediums go to great lengths in their research, memorizing recent death notices in the papers to gather background information on potential audience members, and compiling "test books" or "blue books" of client information that they pass around among fellow mediums.

Private séances tend to take place under stricter conditions, usually dictated by the medium. Carrying out meetings in the dark fell out of fashion after a few high-profile critics like stage magicians Maskelyne and Houdini exposed a series of frauds, so gas lamps remain lit, although most practitioners claim their powers work best with the gaslight turned down extremely low. It is customary for mediums to be held or restrained in some way to prevent them using parlor tricks to fool their audience. It is from this that the practice of everyone holding hands around the table becomes common, although such precautions are easily overcome as fraudsters are not above using a false hand or two to allow them to work unnoticed.

Often the medium enters a trance state to better communicate with the spirits, after which a variety of effects might manifest. In 1871, Kate Fox's English husband, H. D. Jencken, produced a list of the "materializations" that attendees at a séance might expect to witness:
- Hearing rapping and knocking.
- The medium being untroubled by heat from hot coals.
- Movement of objects and levitation of the medium or furniture.
- Hearing words, phrases, music (sung or played on an instrument), and animal or bird calls.
- Spirit writing through the hand of the medium ("automatic writing").
- Sketching of natural objects, such as flowers, and people.
- Writing on a slate or on paper by the spirit.
- Levitation of uncontained fluids.

Other effects produced by mediums included the production of ectoplasm (a glowing, gauze-like substance produced by the interaction of spirits during the medium's trance, often appearing from the mouth or ears of the medium's body), lights, glowing limbs, and musical instruments that played themselves.

It is also extremely common to tie up the medium in a "cabinet," which may simply be an adjoining room, and the sitters sing hymns until the cabinet produces various floating lights, musical noises, glowing faces, and suchlike. When the lights go up, the medium is still bound hand and foot. What possible explanation can there be but the supernatural?

It is up to the Keeper whether a spiritualist holds real power, is a fraudster, or just self-deluded. Everything in the list above can be faked. The methods used by a fake medium depend on the circumstances. In their own rooms, they can use any props available to stage magicians-hidden wires, noise-makers, wax hands for that sepulchral touch, prop furniture that allows a tethered medium to move around in the dark, even fake walls hiding confederates. Some mediums are practiced escapologists.

They may have an assistant (or several) in on the deception, manipulating props, acting as the ghosts, or just distracting clients. Fraudulent mediums make "ectoplasm" by swallowing fine muslin and then regurgitating it at the right moment. Strategically placed phosphorous creates luminescent effects, and it is easily extracted from match-heads.

NPC mediums should have high skill values in Sleight of Hand, Psychology, and Fast Talk, the better to wriggle out of ropes and improvise pronouncements from beyond the grave.

Of course, sooner or later an investigator group is likely to run across a séance where the phenomena are not entirely mundane-this is Call of Cthulhu after all. Once the way is open, or the call put out by the medium, a wide range of beings from other dimensions may manifest, including the dead, the denizens of the Astral Plane, interdimensional intelligences, inhabitants of past ages, secondary personalities, and malign Mythos entities.

## RULES FOR A SÉANCE
If the investigators wish to engage a "real" psychic for a sitting, or an investigator wishes to try, use half POW (or Pulp Cthulhu Medium skill) to determine how successful the medium is in contacting the "other side." Each session of mediumship costs 1D10 magic points and lasts as long as the Keeper desires. With success, the medium falls into a trance state and may, at the Keeper's discretion, summon the presence of a deceased person or another entity, and thereby do one or more of the following:
- Answer questions.
- Relate a message.
- Tell of a future event (possibly a warning) in a suitably vague manner.
- Indicate the vague location of an object of desire (a tome, artifact, etc.).

## THE TRUTH ABOUT THE GOLDEN DAWN
It is your decision as Keeper as to how much actual Mythos magic the Golden Dawn has available, and how much knowledge its NPC members have of the Mythos. You are free to rule that Hermetic Magic is just nonsense, and that the Golden Dawn simply consists of self-deluding though harmless middle-class dabblers on the fringes of the true, unspeakably awful, occult reality. It may be that the Order's members do know some "real" magic but only Folk magic (see The Grand Grimoire of Cthulhu Mythos Magic for more on that).

This chapter, however, presumes that Hermetic magic does have real in-game effects, though not overly powerful ones. It also assumes that most members, including Adepts, have no particular interest in dealing with the Mythos gods, even if they have heard of them-just as they are not particularly interested in dealing with Judeo-Christian/goetic "devils." The Golden Dawn is primarily about spiritual self-improvement for them, and they assume that the Mythos gods are abstract astral/ spiritual entities (or elsewise avatars of human deities) and not an immediate or physical threat to the world, any more than Apep or Beelzebub is.

As Keeper, you are free to spin things differently, and for Pulp Cthulhu games, that is an excellent option; make heavy-hitting spells available to occultists, if you like. Maybe the Golden Dawn secretly devotes itself to combating the Mythos, and the Adepts are out every weekend closing Gates and combating insane sorcerers. Or, alternatively, perhaps one of the Adept cliques secretly worships Yog-Sothoth or some similar entity-Mathers and Farr both have gathered loyal circles, and Crowley is just begging to become a Call of Cthulhu antagonist of some form. In such cases, the investigators may find they have stumbled into a hornets' nest of betrayal and cosmic evil. The options are variedone option is in Cult of the Amber Elder (Chapter 5, page 147). At the very least, you can keep your investigators guessing!

More on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is in the Cthulhu by Gaslight: Investigators' Guide (pages 157-164), and their key personalities have game profiles in [[04 - Notable Victorians| Chapter 4: Notable Victorians (page 111)]].

## USING THE HERMETIC ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN
So, your investigators want to join the Golden Dawn? That is not a bad idea for an extended campaign. At the very least, it provides an investigator-friendly organization where new plot hooks may surface, replacement investigators be found, and financial aid sought from wealthy members. It is also not particularly expensive in comparison to most London clubs: 10s upon first joining, and 2s/6d annually, along with the cost of robes and pamphlets. The organization provides a network of "interesting" personal contacts, plus teaching in the Occult skill and some esoteric abilities. And it may, at the Keeper's discretion, provide actual magical teaching.

Remember that many of the Order's members are highly regarded members of society and are sensitive to the risk of scandal and exposure. So, while individual members may have some Cthulhu Mythos knowledge and experience, the Order itself keeps a low profile.

Access to its influential members (both in terms of the occult and wider society) could be of great use to investigators from time to time, but temper this with the turbulent history of the Golden Dawn. It may well be that at the time of the investigators' greatest need, the Golden Dawn may be facing exposure or going through one of its many schisms. If they pick a side, it may have an impact on their future interactions with other members.

## NEOPHYTE INITIATION
It is not recommended that investigators are run, in game, through a historical initiation rite to the various grades. Golden Dawn ritual symbology is complex, dense, un-intuitive, and quite honestly not as entertaining as a normal game session. The Neophyte Initiation summary follows:

The candidate wears a black robe, bound with a triple cord that represents the restrictions of Nature that are shortly to be removed, and a blindfold representing their ignorance.

An officiant leads them into a large hall in which various members of the Order are waiting in positions symbolizing spheres on the Kabbalistic tree of life. Each member has a ritual function, representing a god or an occult concept. The candidate, addressed as "Child of Earth," progresses from node to node, led by "Anubis of the East." The repeated challenges by the "Anubis of the West" or "Kerux," necessitate purification by goddesses wielding water and fire before further progress can take place. The candidate receives their motto, kneels before three Adepts representing the Supernal Triad, and makes a pledge which follows (in part):

*To keep secret the Order, its name, and the names of the members, as well as the proceedings which take place at its meetings. To maintain kindly and benevolent relation with all the Fraters and Sorors of the Order. To prosecute with zeal and study the occult sciences. To observe the above under the awful penalty of submitting myself to a deadly and hostile current of will set in motion by the chiefs of the Order, by which I should fall slain or paralyzed without visible weapon, as if blasted by the lightning flash.*

They only get a few glimpses of the hall from under the blindfold and are threatened briefly by the three members of a Dark Triad. Eventually, after many consecrations and promises, the officiants utter the words, *"Child of Earth! Long hast thou dwelt in darkness! Quit the night, and seek the day!"* and remove the blindfolds. The Supernal Triad declares, *"Frater/Soror [name], we receive thee into the Order of the Golden Dawn!"*

The leadership presents the badge of the grade, and then instructs them on the symbolism of the grade. Finally, the Kerux conducts the Neophyte to a table and gives them a bottle of liquid, telling them to pour a few drops on the plate before them. As they do so, the solution changes to a blood color, and the Kerux says, "As this pure, colorless, and limpid fluid is changed into the semblance of blood, so mayest thou change and perish, if thou betrayest thine oath of secrecy of this Order, by word or deed!"

A brief closing ceremony follows.

## JOINING THE ORDER
Investigators interested in joining the Order must demonstrate a sincere interest in the occult and have an introduction to the Order from another member.

Some members want to learn everything the Order can teach them, from Enochian to Alchemy. They study hard and rise through the grades. A focused person could complete the First Order grades in between one and two years of dedicated study, although other employment would slow that considerably. Other members love the pomp and mysticism of the ceremonies, the dressing up in robes, and become fine ritualists, but don't rise in grade. But to get the most out of the Golden Dawn, investigators should neglect neither the academic learning nor the ceremonialism.

Initiates must sign a pledge of silence about what they learn within the Order. They must also create their own motto (usually in Latin, although Mathers' is in Scots Gaelic), which other members of the society will use in place of their real name.

The First, or Outer Order, consists of Neophyte and four degrees, or grades, as follows, awarded by examination:
- Neophyte $(0=0)$
- Zelator (1=10)
- Theoricus (2=9)
- Practicus (3=8)
- Philosophus (4=7)
- Portal Stage

The numbers after the degree titles are of Kabbalistic meaning, each number representing one of the ten spheres (Sephiroth) of the Hebrew tree of life, as well as a divine name of God in Hebrew, an archangel, an order of angels, a color, and an element. The $1=10$ grade (Zelator), for example, ties to the element Earth (1) and the Divine (10), signifying that the ritualist dwells in the earthly realm but aspires to the divine. At the other end of the scale, for the Secret Masters, the Ipsissimus ( $10=1$ ) is the peak of occult mastery and dwells in the divine realm.

The Second, or Inner Order, also known as the Order of the Rose of Ruby and the Cross of Gold, consists of three further degrees. Members of the Inner Order teach initiates in the Outer Order, determine which candidates can join the Order, and issue warrants to create new temples. Until 1892, only Mathers, Westcott, and Woodman are members of the Inner Order.
- Adeptus Minor (5=6)
- Adeptus Major (6=5)
- Adeptus Exemptus (7=4)

These grades expand in 1894 to replace Adeptus Minor with:
- Zelator Adeptus Minor (5=6)
- Theoricus Adeptus Minor (5=6)
- Practicus Adeptus Minor (5=6)

Finally, there are the three degrees of the Secret Masters, these being:
- Magister Templi (8=3)
- Magus (9=2)
- Ipsissimus (10=1)

However, no student has ever achieved these degrees. The current holders exist only on the Astral Plane.

## THE ASTRAL PLANE
Working on the Astral Plane is extremely important in Golden Dawn practice. The evocation of a god, the binding of devils (as in the Abramelin Ritual, page 63), the raising of cones of power, and other similar tasks normally take place in the Astral rather than the mundane world-i.e., an outside observer would see nothing supernatural and might very well claim that the magical practitioner is hallucinating, imagining things...or pretending. The difference might not always be terribly clear to the practitioner either.

The existence of the Astral Plane has an abundance of attestations from mystics, yogis, and spiritual philosophers, but incontrovertible facts are few. The following claims (some contradictory) are among the more common:
- The Astral Plane underlies material reality and occupies the same space, but the denizens of the two do not normally interact.
- The Astral Plane is the corridor between Life and the Afterlife, crossed by the soul on the way to being born, and after death. It is full of ghosts.
- The Astral Plane is the Catholic realm of Limbo.
- The Astral Plane is the Celestial Realm above the terrestrial Earth, wherein reside the Planetary Intelligences and Spirits.
- You can visit the Astral Plane consciously through astral projection, shamanic journeying, meditation and mantra, near-death experience, lucid dreaming, or other means. It is only the conscious self/soul that ventures forth this way, leaving the material body (still alive) behind.
- The Astral Plane's population consists of gods, angels, spirits, or other higher beings, including the Secret Chiefs of the Golden Dawn.
- The Astral Plane's population consists of monsters that devour unwary souls.
- Astral entities can fasten or feed upon living people in the Material World-causing personality changes, physical malaise, melancholy, obsession, emotional problems, and insanity. Magical practitioners are particularly likely to draw the attention of these parasites.
- The Astral Plane has no set geography.
- The Astral Plane has a similar geography to the material world, in that at least some of the same landmarks are visible in both.
- You can travel swiftly via the Astral Plane to spy on anywhere in the material world, but the view is not always terribly clear.
- The Astral Plane is described as "misty," "shadowy," "luminous," "dark," or "fluid."
- Astral bodies of the living remain attached to their material bodies by a cord (sometimes described as "silver"), and, if severed, it is near impossible to find one's way back.
- Astral projection leaves the empty material body open to possession by other entities.

The Astral Plane has its own fauna; it is also a place where one may encounter entities who are just "passing through." "Gods" and "devils" may be there, but the Order teaches that they are not so much individual personalities as forms or emanations of the impersonal, indefinable, unknowable, un-acting Supreme Cause or Light, as comprehended through the wisdom of the ancients-through which the occultist can encounter, embody, and ascend to unity with that ultimate godhead.

Ra "exists" not because he made the world, but because Ancient Egyptians gave symbolic shape to the divine power of creation (and by "exists" the Order means "can be magically evoked"it is not at all clear that Ra has any personal consciousness or active life beyond that). Golden Dawn occultism is not pagan worship.

In Cthulhu Mythos terms, one may draw an unpleasant comparison between the underlying, personality-less Ain Soph, or Unknowable God, of whom the universe is the living body, and Azathoth, the mindless center of the universe. Or between the ten spheres of the Sephiroth, those divine emanations that encompass all of existence and time, and Yog-Sothoth the one-inall and all-in-one. But these are deep mystical waters and are left for the Keeper to explore or to avoid. This side of things is very much up to the Keeper's interpretation.

It is certainly possible, in theory, for investigators to evoke Bast or other gods of the Earth (or the Dreamlands) and meet them on the Astral Plane. Occultists would be beyond foolish to try to travel astrally to R'lyeh, Carcosa, or the Court of Azathoth, although that sort of out-of-body experience sometimes occurs in Mythos fiction. Some have reported that the Court of Azathoth exerts a kind of "gravitational pull" on astral travelers that venture too far out into space. Travelers who find they are unable to break free from their trance may become trapped for eternity, changed, or be devoured.

The Golden Dawn underemphasizes the dangers of the Astral Plane to members of the Outer Order. They encourage solo exploration and advise that the Pentagram of Protection is normally sufficient, but if something unpleasant or hostile crosses their path, the occultist needs only keep their distance or wake voluntarily from their trance to escape. This isn't bad advice, as far as it goes...but it really isn't comprehensive.
