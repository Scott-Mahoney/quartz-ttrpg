> # Astral Predator, sharks from beyond
> ![[Astral Predator.png|shark]]
> ###### General Information
> 	On their own plane, astral predators appear as enormous, bloated maggots, propelled by whipping cilia. Their puckered mouthparts unfurl to reveal rows of spiralling teeth as they lunge at their prey. They are completely invisible on the Material Plane. 
> 	They seek to feed upon magic points, and, if the victim has a material body, they may possess it once all the victim's MPs are consumed, although this happens relatively rarely and may be a mistake on the astral predator's part-it is possible that it simply gets "stuck" in its prey's body, like a trash-diving fox with its head wedged in the can it has been licking clean. Astral predators vary in size, and the profile below defines an average specimen.
